# JavaScript Learning Path

A repository to document my journey of learning JavaScript. This includes notes, code snippets, exercises, and small projects.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is recommended).
- A code editor of your choice, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Setup

If you plan to use external libraries, you can initialize a `package.json` file:
```bash
npm init -y
```

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository can be organized to keep learning materials structured. You can adapt this structure as you see fit.

- `/01-basics`: Core concepts, data types, operators, control flow.
- `/02-functions`: In-depth look at functions, scope, and closures.
- `/03-dom-manipulation`: Examples of interacting with the Document Object Model.
- `/04-async-js`: Promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
- `/projects`: Small, hands-on projects to apply learned concepts.
- `/notes`: Personal notes and summaries on various topics.

## 🏃‍♀️ Running the Code

Most of the code can be run in one of two ways:

1.  **In the Browser:** Open the corresponding `.html` file in your web browser and open the developer console (usually with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) to see the output.
2.  **Using Node.js:** Run standalone `.js` files from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node path/to/your/file.js
    ```

## 📚 Learning Goals

This is a checklist of topics I plan to cover:

- [ ] JavaScript Fundamentals (Variables, Data Types, Operators)
- [ ] Control Flow (If/Else, Loops, Switch)
- [ ] Functions & Scope
- [ ] Arrays & Objects
- [ ] DOM Manipulation & Events
- [ ] Asynchronous JavaScript (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)
- [ ] ES6+ Features (Arrow Functions, Destructuring, etc.)
