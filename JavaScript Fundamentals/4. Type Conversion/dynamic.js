/* JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it.
Instead, the type is determined based on the value assigned to the variable while the program is running. 
This allows you to change the type of a variable throughout the program.*/

let data = 100; // Initially a number
data = "New data"; // Dynamically changes to a string
